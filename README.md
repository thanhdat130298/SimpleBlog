# Intro
This project to improve my knowledge and challenges me to work with deadline.
First of all, I am very grateful to the individual and organization that facilitated me to take this test. Although not fully functional to meet the deadline, I will still try to complete the work as complete as possible.
Currently, 6:00 AM 28/11/2022, this project is not done with main requirements yet, there is some function was missing:
1. Update post
2. Filter, sort, search post
3. Error handdling
4. Lazyloading
5. Bad code convention
6. Structure maybe not good
...
Maybe it's not good with anyone view it. But I think i tried with my best.
